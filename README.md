# Robocon CAD Model – Robotics Design Project

This repository contains the complete CAD design for the **Robocon Robot**, developed for participation in the annual **ABU Robocon Competition**. Designed using **SolidWorks**, the model focuses on structural stability, motion efficiency, and task-specific mechanisms as per the competition requirements.

---

## Project Structure

The robot is modularly divided into three key systems:

### 1. Locomotive Part
- Designed and led by **Himanshu Verma**
- Focus on **wheelbase design**, **motor mountings**, and **mobility mechanics**
- Ensured smooth motion, compact structure, and stability

### 2. Main Chassis
- Central supporting body connecting all modules
- Designed for **structural integrity** and easy part integration

### 3. Travel and Throwing Mechanism
- Mechanism to pick, carry, and throw elements as per game rules
- Used **linkages**, **servo mounts**, and **actuation-friendly geometry**

## Objectives

- To design a complete robot that meets Robocon task and motion requirements  
- To model each subsystem with **precision**, **clarity**, and **functionality**  
- To simulate assembly and motion using **SolidWorks Motion Analysis**
