# 🤖 Robocon CAD Model – Robotics Design Project

This repository contains the complete CAD design for the **Robocon Robot**, developed for participation in the annual **ABU Robocon Competition**. Designed using **SolidWorks**, the model focuses on structural stability, motion efficiency, and task-specific mechanisms as per the competition requirements.

---

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The robot is modularly divided into three key systems:

### 1. Locomotive Part 🚗
- Designed and led by **Himanshu Verma**
- Focus on **wheelbase design**, **motor mountings**, and **mobility mechanics**
- Ensured smooth motion, compact structure, and stability

### 2. Main Chassis 🔩
- Central supporting body connecting all modules
- Designed for **structural integrity** and easy part integration

### 3. Travel and Throwing Mechanism 🎯
- Mechanism to pick, carry, and throw elements as per game rules
- Used **linkages**, **servo mounts**, and **actuation-friendly geometry**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- To design a complete robot that meets Robocon task and motion requirements  
- To model each subsystem with **precision**, **clarity**, and **functionality**  
- To simulate assembly and motion using **SolidWorks Motion Analysis**

---

## 💡 My Contribution

- **Team Lead** for the **Locomotive Design**
- Managed and modeled the base frame, motor integration, and wheel alignment
- Supported other sub-teams in design troubleshooting and final integration
- Performed motion analysis for real-world testing scenarios
